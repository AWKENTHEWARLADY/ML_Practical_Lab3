Text Analysis and NLP: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland 📖✨

Project Overview

This project introduces students to Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on processing and analyzing text data from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.

The project demonstrates fundamental NLP techniques such as:

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Stemming and Lemmatization

Bag of Words representation

Frequency analysis

By completing this project, students gain hands-on experience in understanding and manipulating text data, a critical skill in Data Science and AI applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, and text classification.

Why Text Analysis and NLP?

NLP allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include:

Search engines

Sentiment analysis

Machine translation

Chatbots

Text summarization

Analyzing text data helps extract meaningful insights and automate tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention.

Dataset

Source: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll

Format: Plain text (.txt)

Project Steps
1. Data Preparation


Convert text to lowercase

Remove punctuation

2. Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization

Tokenized text using TreebankWordTokenizer

Applied SnowballStemmer and WordNetLemmatizer


3. Stopword Removal

Removed common English stopwords using NLTK

4. Bag of Words

Created a dictionary mapping each word to its frequency

  5. Word Frequency Analysis
 
Most Common Words

Words Appearing n Times

Tools & Libraries

Python 3

NLTK (TreebankWordTokenizer, SnowballStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer, stopwords)

String, urllib
